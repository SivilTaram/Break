- *Check out [our blogpost](https://medium.com/ai2-blog) at the official [AI2 blog!](https://medium.com/ai2-blog)*  

[Our research](https://allenai.github.io/Break/#paper) has already shown that multi-hop QA models utilizing Break decompositions greatly outperform a string baseline which does not. Additionally, we provide reasonbale models trained on the task of QDMR parsing, that beat a rule-based baseline that employs dependency parsing and coreference resolution.
